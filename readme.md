This project is a page for a fictional tourism company located in Yucatan, Mexico. It features the use of responsive design through two media queries and Flexbox to ensure user friendly access on both mobile and desktop devices.

Accessing this project does not require any special setup.

Feature List: 

-Just under the header, you can find a countdown timer, fulfilling the feature requirement to calculate and display data based on an external factor (in this case, new summer tours coming 7/10). This feature includes a function that auto-updates the expiration year annually so that it will forever reflect a date in the future.

-Below the list of attractions, you can find a random attraction generator, fulfilling the requirement of creating an array, dictionary, or list and populating it with multiple values, then retrieving and displaying one or more of those values. Users who would rather have their activties selected at random can use this feature by simply clicking the "click here" button and receiving an alert with their suggestion.

-Because international travel often requires conversion of currency, this project includes a USD to MXN currency converter tool. The user is prompted to enter their selected activity price, press the "convert" button, and are then given the equivalent cost in pesos (exchange rate is accurate as of 11/18/2021). This satisfies the feature to build a conversion tool that converts user input into another type and displays it.

-If users decide sign up for the newsletter, their email address will be validated, using Regex, to ensure a proper email format was entered. This satisfies the feature to impliment a regular expression to ensure a field (phone or email) is always stored and displayed in the same format.

Enjoy the tour!
